Install git-core on Ubuntu/Deb. Adjust according to your distribution installer.

sudo apt-get install git-core
git clone https://github.com/sigurdga/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
Change directory into the downloaded Solarized directory

cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
Run one of the following scripts for either the dark or light color theme.

./set_dark.sh
./set_light.sh
There are Solarized color palettes available for terminals, editors, IDEs etc. Easy to set up and beautiful to look at. I highly recommend checking it out.
